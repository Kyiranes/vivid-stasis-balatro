Mod based on the rhythm game vivid/stasis by Cheryl Stelli.

Still in development, but contact me at developercommentary on discord for any information.

Card art/suggestions are open and accepted!

Thank you for giving my mod a chance!

Requires the most recent version of steamodded, due to coding concerns.
